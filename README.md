## My process  

### Built with  

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- SCSS (SASS)  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Bootstrap 5  
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned  

Working on this project helped me reinforce my understanding of:  

- **SCSS (SASS)**: Using SCSS for better organization, reusable variables, and cleaner code.  
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Maintaining consistent styling using variables across the project.  
- **Flexbox**: Aligning and distributing space among items in a container.  
- **Responsive Design**: Creating a layout that adapts well to different screen sizes using media queries and Bootstrap.  

---

### Continued development  

In future projects, I aim to:  

- **Explore CSS Grid**: For more complex layouts and design patterns.  
- **Improve Accessibility**: By testing and enhancing the accessibility features of the website.  
- **Incorporate JavaScript**: To add interactive elements and dynamic content.

## Installation & Setup  

To run this project locally, follow these steps:  

### Prerequisites  

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.  
- Install a SASS compiler like `sass` globally or locally.  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Yashi-Singh-9/Recipe-Page.git  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd Recipe-Page  
   ```  

3. Install dependencies (if any for SCSS/Bootstrap workflows).  

4. Compile SCSS:  
   If you are using the `sass` CLI, you can compile SCSS into CSS with the following command:  
   ```bash  
   sass styles.scss styles.css  
   ```  
   To watch for changes:  
   ```bash  
   sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css  
   ```
